Need to read: pyshtools implement r(phi,theta) Now I want x(phi,theta),y(phi,theta),z(phi,theta) so that I can get the real original shape!

orbital angular momentum operators 轨道角动量算符

Real spherical harmonics (RSH) are obtained by combining complex conjugate functions associated to opposite values of *m*. 

standard least-squares estimation 最小二乘法

x(phi,theta),y(phi,theta),z(phi,theta) is the SHE : spherical harmonics expansiono. Also known as extended Fourier methods.

## How to extend 2D to 3D?

need to read !

## Registration

When objects are being compared, their SPHARM models must be placed into a common reference system in order for corresponding coefficients in the two models to be comparable and to allow appropriate morphing between them.
