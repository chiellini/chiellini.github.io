## KEY: reconstruction and modeling of embryogenesis

* compare the color-coded fate and quantitative cell morphological properties
  * tree-distance to classify asymmetric and symmetric (cell fate)
* hypothesis: contact area-dependent cell communication imposes constraints on embryonic geometries.
  * tree-edit distance (time domain, easy to do registration)
  * 

# Abstract

* invertebrate 無脊椎
* homologous 同源的
* rationale 理由

# Introduction

* early embryonic cell lineages are considered invariant
* constitute attractive model systems to study the mechanisms driving cellular reproducibility.

# Rationale

* To quantify embryonic reproducibility in the ascidian ..., cell lineages, cell shapes, cell interations.
* segmentation and tracking of embryonic cells procedure(ASTEC)
* Development of  ascidians is characterized by lower cell number and earlier fate restriction. 94 of 110 early gastrula cells are fate restricted.

# Result

* Up to neurula, embryos develop without cell growth , programmed cell death, or cell neghbor exchanges.
* Beyond cell position, cell cycle duration, and cell lineages we observed a high reproducibility of cell arrangements: 
* mechanistically, we uncovered a tight link between the control of cell arragements and asymmetric cell divisions.(which give rise to sister cells of distinct fates)
* Combine

# Conclusion
* Establishes the highly reproducible ascidian embryo as a framework to bridge cell behaviors, morphogenesis, and the underlying regulatory program.
