# abstract

* fail-safe(自动防故障的)
* robust self-organization phenomenon
* cell migration(迁移) trajectory（轨道）
* mechanical cues
* push cells into position where they experience the least repulsive forces
* mechanically guided progress is properly timed
* how : remained elusive(difficult to know)
* cell volumes and division times are strongly anticorrelated 
* somatic cells and precursor of germline are correlated
* their experimental findings by a simple models
  * model in conjunction with mechanical guidance can account for the fail-safe early embryogenesis of C.elegans.

# introduction

* C.ELEGANS are protected and eutely.
* EUTELY : require egg shell robust and fail-safe, migrate to meaningful spatial positions.
* migration is invarient.
* explained:machanical model
  * cells interact via repulsive protentials(势能)
  * it predicted cells to relax towards positions of least repulsion after miosis(有丝分裂)
* how do individual cells know 
  * right now is a good choice for a meaningful and robust mechanically driven arrangement of all cells in the embryo
* onset of gastrulation
* how individual cells are coupled to the mechanics of the rest fo the embryo

# Methomology
* why volumes and cell lifetimes are anticorrelated work?
* M phase(mitosis period) is constant?
* S phase (preceding preparation period) varied markedly with cell size?


# Explanation
* P granules are deposited in cells of P lineage
* P granules have benn implicated to sequester(使隐退) NPCs
  * why alpha is bigger the cells of other lineage
* Maybe linked to a temporal 

# Experiment
* RNAi to get smaller or bigger
* deviations 误差
* instantaneous 瞬间的
* anterior 前面的 posterior 后面的 
* phenotype 表现型
* gastrulation 原肠胚形成
* what is mechanical model? Eq(1)? 
* which are crucial ingredients for proper embryogenesis?
* intact 完整的
* unperturbed 未干扰的，未被打扰的
* bifurcation 分枝
* fine tune 微调
* 

# conclusion
* control timming can inflence division
  * and late division result in mechanical difference.
  * mechanically driven migration exist.
