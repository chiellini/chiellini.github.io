# abstract

* fail-safe(自动防故障的)
* robust self-organization phenomenon
* cell migration(迁移) trajectory（轨道）
* mechanical cues
* push cells into position where they experience the least repulsive forces
* mechanically guided progress is properly timed
* how : remained elusive(difficult to know)
* cell volumes and division times are strongly anticorrelated 
* somatic cells and precursor of germline are correlated
* their experimental findings by a simple models
  * model in conjunction with mechanical guidance can account for the fail-safe early embryogenesis of C.elegans.

# introduction

* C.ELEGANS are protected and eutely.
* EUTELY : require egg shell robust and fail-safe, migrate to meaningful spatial positions.
* migration is invarient.
* explained:machanical model
  * cells interact via repulsive protentials(势能)
  * it predicted cells to relax towards positions of least repulsion after miosis(有丝分裂)
