# Problem

## How to generate a series of points on sphere evenly?

* It is not easy as you think. Average distance on xyz or $$r\phi\theta$$ cannot generate the point on a 2D circle or 3D sphere. They will very dense at polar. We will make an contrast between fibonacci spiral sphere and average walk pointing shpere. 

* In order to quantify the sphere-like shapes of objects, we need to propose a method to describe the surface of the points on objects. We have an idea is that ...

* If we can generate these equidistant points, we can define the energy distribute on the surface of sphere-like objects.

# Fibonacci Squence & golden ratio

* A method based on a spiral walk of the spherical surface in angular increments equal to the golden angle. On mathematics, we call it The Fibonacci Sequence or Golden Ratio.

## Golden Ratio

Golden Ratio is an Irrational Number(meaning we cannot write it as a simple fraction), like $ \pi $ and $ e $. The golden ratio grows from fibonacci squence. We can derive it from this formula: $\varphi = \frac{1}{\varphi}$

expanded formula:

$$\varphi = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{...}}}$$

To solve this equation, we can get $\varphi$ is 1.61803...

## Golden Angle

This the the golden angle looks like:

![golden_angle](https://github.com/chiellini/pictures_sources/blob/master/golden_angle.jpg?raw=true)

a and b satisfy the following relationship: $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{a+b}{b}:=\varphi$

so we get the golden angle b which is approximately 2.399963... radians or 123.50776... degress. We generate it in our program via 

$$
(3-\sqrt{5})*\pi
$$


# Fibonacci Spiral Circle

Scattering the points evenly on a circle is not as easy as you think. Some methods like producing very large amount of random points on circles looks like a good ways. But we cannot control the number and cannot get average distribution. 

Using [Vogal's Method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0025556479900804?via%3Dihub) we can generate a series of points distributing on circle evenly, which can combine the golden angle with an increasing radius $r$. 

Here is my implementation:

```
def fibonacci_spiral_disc(num_points, density_inverse=10):
    points = []

    phi = math.pi * (3. - math.sqrt(5.))  # golden angle in radians - 2.39999 radian (compared to degrees 137)

    for i in range(num_points):
        radius = math.sqrt(i) * density_inverse
        theta = phi * i  # golden angle increment
        x = math.cos(theta) * radius
        y = math.sin(theta) * radius

        points.append([x, y])

    return points
```

* Density_inverse means that the more density you want, this values should smaller.

# Fibonacci Spiral Sphere

Like the fibonacci spiral circle, we want to find out a way to generate the points evenly on the sphere.

If the spiral starts at a sphereâ€™s pole then the radius and circumference of the spiral at any point is proportional to $cos(lat)$ for $lat$ in $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$ and the continuous distribution function (CDF) of the turns proportional to $sin(lat)+1$.

With this CDF, the point index $i$ of a latitude can be calculated with $i = \frac{N+1}{2}(sin(lat)+1) $ for $N$ the total number of points required. Then we can get $lat = arcsin(i\frac{N+1}{2}-1)$ .

Here is my code
```
def XXX():
  points_cartesian = []
  points_spherical = []
  # https://bduvenhage.me/geometry/2019/07/31/generating-equidistant-vectors.html#:~:text=Summary,three%20points%20to%20the%20sphere.
  phi = math.pi * (3. - math.sqrt(5.))  # golden angle in radians - 2.39999 radian (compared to degrees 137)

  # latitude direction  pi ---?  polar angle ------from x, not from z
  # longitude direction 2pi  ---?azimuth angle

  for i in range(num_points):
      lat = math.asin(-1.0 + 2.0 * float(i / (num_points + 1)))
      # lat = lat % (-math.pi) if lat < 0 else lat % math.pi
      # lat = lat % (2*math.pi)
      lon = phi * i

      x = math.cos(lon) * math.cos(lat) * radius
      y = math.sin(lon) * math.cos(lat) * radius
      z = math.sin(lat) * radius

      points_cartesian.append([x, y, z])
      # points_spherical.append([radius, lat, lon])

  points_np_cartesian = np.array(points_cartesian)
  # points_np_spherical = np.array(points_spherical)
  return points_np_cartesian
```
