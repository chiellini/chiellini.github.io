# 2021 research record and what need to do next week

--update and report on each Monday!--

## 9-3-2021 ~ 16-3-2021
1. find out whether there is any problem in drawing function(draw all pls)
2. use cube  multiple face object to evaluate my clustering method
3. guoye sent me the paper, read it -- population level, cell level

## 1-3-2021 ~ 8-3-2021

1. check clustering effect, use cude and sphere
2. add similar PCA coefficients
3. combine all cell 200000 together to do PCA
4. no PCA
5. try 2-norm distance(euclidean distance) to do quanlification and then calculate the root-mean-square deviation(RMSD)
